# SydneyBikeMap (WIP)

https://sydneybikemap.ethan.link/

**Work in progress!**

A vector tile style and website designed for viewing bicycle infrastructure in Sydney and surrounds.

The area that the map covers is roughly based on the extents of the intercity trains network, as this is a good gauge for "near Sydney" if you can get to it with your Opal card and without having to box your bike :)

Why not all of NSW? Because it's easier to host and allows me to keep this site free, and since most bike infrastructure is in urban areas like Sydney/Newcastle/Wollongong anyway. If you would like to host your own version with all of NSW, Australia or the world, feel free. You can also run it locally and choose the area you would like (see tiles/README.md, you'd need to edit tiles/bbox.poly).
